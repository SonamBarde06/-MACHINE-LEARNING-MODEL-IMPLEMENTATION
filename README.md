DESCRIPTION:
This script effectively demonstrates the process of building a spam detection system using machine learning. By leveraging libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn, it efficiently handles data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. The use of the Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier is particularly suitable for text classification tasks, making this approach a practical solution for spam detection.
